# CIS331-Final-Project

This is the Final project of CIS331 **Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligent**. This project focuses on classifying a subset of these hand gesture images using **convolutional neural networks**. Specifically, given an image of a hand showing one of the letters A-E, we want to detect which letter is being represented.

## Result
The highest accuracy of the model I had is 100 with 0.02 loss.
The result of testing set is 100 accuracy with 0.04 loss.

## Bonus
Use model to make prediction in real-time.
